# hello-world
Just playing around seeing what all this coding is all about....
I'm 36, i've been working for myself for the last 7 years as a freelance wedding photographer - awesome one too
the last two year i've been freelancing for a small studio as their sales and marketing manager with as well as doing 
a bit of business dev for them, but i have now done my time there
Need a change!!!
